# Target Users

## Primary Audience

Our web application is designed for UMass undergraduate and graduate students, offering a convenient and budget-friendly rideshare solution. The primary audience includes students who often need transportation during breaks or long weekends, whether they're going home or traveling to nearby cities. Many students face challenges in finding affordable rides, especially if they donâ€™t have a car. This platform bridges that gap by connecting two groups: students with cars willing to offer rides to those traveling in the same direction, and students without cars looking for transportation.

By enabling users to split gas costs, the app makes travel more affordable and reduces the environmental impact through carpooling. Beyond cost-saving, it fosters a stronger campus community by encouraging students to collaborate, connect, and trust one another. The app simplifies the process of organizing shared rides, providing a safe and easy way for students to find and offer transportation, benefiting both drivers and passengers.

## User Needs



## Why These Users Matter

These users deserve enhanced opportunities for travel, particularly when public options are often limited or inaccessible. By providing a reliable transportation solution, we can alleviate one of the significant stressors that many students face when it comes to breaks, holidays or any time of the year. Securing dependable transportation can greatly impact their overall well-being, improving both morale and productivity as they navigate their academic and personal responsibilities. 

Furthermore, this approach fosters a sense of community by facilitating connections through person-to-person communication. When users engage with one another to coordinate rides, they not only find practical solutions to their travel needs but also forge meaningful relationships within and around the UMass Amherst community. These connections and interactions can enhance the overall student experience, making it simpler for individuals to support one another while cultivating a vibrant, more collaborative atmosphere.
