## Why These Users Matter

These users deserve enhanced opportunities for travel, particularly when public options are often limited or inaccessible. By providing a reliable transportation solution, we can alleviate one of the significant stressors that many students face when it comes to breaks, holidays or any time of the year. Securing dependable transportation can greatly impact their overall well-being, improving both morale and productivity as they navigate their academic and personal responsibilities. 

Furthermore, this approach fosters a sense of community by facilitating connections through person-to-person communication. When users engage with one another to coordinate rides, they not only find practical solutions to their travel needs but also forge meaningful relationships within and around the UMass Amherst community. These connections and interactions can enhance the overall student experience, making it simpler for individuals to support one another while cultivating a vibrant, more collaborative atmosphere.
