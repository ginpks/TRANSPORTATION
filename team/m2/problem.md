# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

Since UMass Amherst is located in an area where transportation to cities such as Boston or New York is limited, many students seek transportation to these destinations during breaks. However, not everyone has a vehicle or someone to drive them, while some students travel alone. We propose an app to connect these two groups, facilitating ride-sharing and ensuring everyone can reach their destinations efficiently.

## Proposed Solution

By listing users’ estimated time of departure and destination, other users can choose to contact and set up a shared ride together. In this way, user A can earn some extra money while user B can get a cheap ride to their destination. This provides a much more enjoyable and convenient experience than say, taking public transportation. 

Key features include:

- **Ride posting**: Car owners and those in need of a ride can post their trip details. The system connects users with matching destinations and schedules for ride-sharing.
- **Private messaging**: Users can chat to arrange ride details and coordinate plans.
- **Location tracking**: Provided map helps showcase the exact location for better communication
- **Feedback form**: Rate your ride experience and leave comments to help others make informed choices.

## Why This Matters

By facilitating transportation for students in need of it, we’re addressing a real need and fostering a sense of community. Not only can this initiative benefit UMass Amherst, but other rural schools as well. The purpose of this project aligns perfectly with the vision of CICS: computing for the common good.
