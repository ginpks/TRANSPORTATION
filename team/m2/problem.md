# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

As we are located in the middle of nowhere, whenever breaks come, most of the students want to travel to cities, such as Boston, NewYork, etc. However, not all of them have a car or someone to drive them, while some drive by themselves. Therefore, we propose an idea for these two types of students to share a ride together. 

## Proposed Solution

By listing usersâ€™ estimated time of departure and destination, other users can choose to contact and set up a shared ride together. In this way, user A can earn some extra money while user B can get a cheap ride to the destination with a way better experience than taking the bus. 

Key features include:

- **Ride posting**: postings from car owners who are ready to provide a ride or people who need one, Users who need a ride also can post information and the system can connect the different users who have the same destination and time to share a ride.
- **Private messaging**: chat to connect with each other for ride details
- **Location tracking**: provided map helps showcase the exact location for better communication
- **Feedback form**: rate your ride experience and leave your comments 

## Why This Matters

Helping students in University of Massachusetts, Amherst, using our skill base is our honor, and it can be applied to other schools which are in rural areas as well. The purpose of this project also matches the vision of CICS: computing for the common good.
